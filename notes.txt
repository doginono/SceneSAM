    -- why visual artefacts in new trajectory?
    -> render metrics from panoptic lifting for our replica implementation
    -> segmenter.run and not runAuto for replica
    -> panoptic Scannet sceen in our model
    -> maybe (run panoptic for more than the given sceens)
    -> check if panoptic lifting provides meshes of their computation -> how to use this blender files?

8 April
    -run panoptic lifting
    -run novel trajectory from NERF model
    -why output dimension semantic affects runtime of only normal nice-slam

31. März
    check why only a fiew samples are projected into the current frame.

if full_slam:
    1. start semgent thread
    2. if tracker tracked the frame: let both mappers and segmenter continue
    3. if normal mapper reaches stage semantic: wait for segmenter 

possible efficiency improvements:
-unnecessary reading of depth and color for round 1 in postprocess
-unnecessary read of segmetnation in full_slam
-technically the self.semenatic_frames array is not used, since the segmentations are written to file, but with the 
    bigger machine we could also consider not writing to file but just using that array

full slam:
    implement merging on Automatic Maskgenerator and fix the previous keyframes
